Before going to setup cakePHP Framework in your XAMPP server, we assume you have already running XAMPP on your machine.

Steps for Installing CakePHP:
1. Download the stable version of CakePHP from: https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/tags as ZIP file.

2. Then, create a folder as "cake" (you can choose the folder name of your own) in your webview folder of XAMPP i.e. "htdocs" folder.

3. Now, unzip the file into your local directory and copy all contents to "htdocs/cake" directory.

4. After that open “httpd.conf” located on “xampp/apache/conf” folder. Then uncomment the line that contains “mod_rewrite”. This is needed to enable Cake’s pretty URL such as “http://localhost/cake/users/view” instead of “http://localhost/cake/index.php/users/view”.

/////////Then configure Database for cakePHP/////////////////

5. Visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin and create a database for CakePHP (for example I have created the database with name "cake")
6. Now, goto "./htdocs/cake/app/Config/" folder and rename the "database.php.default" file to "database.php".
7. Then, open "database.php" in a Text Editor and change the “$default” variable to suit your database settings. 

For Example:
class DATABASE_CONFIG {
	public $default = array(
		'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
		'persistent' => false,
		'host' => 'localhost',
		'login' => 'root',
		'password' => 'fusion',
		'database' => 'cake',
		'prefix' => '',
		//'encoding' => 'utf8',
	);
	public $test = array(
		'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
		'persistent' => false,
		'host' => 'localhost',
		'login' => 'root',
		'password' => 'fusion',
		'database' => 'cake',
		'prefix' => '',
		//'encoding' => 'utf8',
	);
} 

8. Now open the "./htdocs/cake/app/Config/core.php" file in Text Editor , and do the below changes.

Visit the URL: https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm and copy the random string and replace with the string as mentioned below:

Configure::write('Security.salt', 'DYhG93b0qyJfIxfs2guVoUubWwvniR2G0FgaC9mi');

Changed to:

Configure::write('Security.salt', 'D98D3C1318DF9DFE9770E217D5724129EE18496532291B887CD4000497AD35EE');

>>Now visit the URL "http://localhost/cake" and you will get the cakePHP Development FrameWork page.

Installation Complete !!
